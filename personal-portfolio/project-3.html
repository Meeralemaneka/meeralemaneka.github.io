 <h1>Project 3</h1>
  
  <h3>HEAD AND THUMBS</h3>
  
  <p>Here are some stills from my twine project</p>
  <p>I decided to have a little fun with this project and make it as humorous as I could</p>
  <p>I even loaded it up with audio and special effects to make it more intersting for the players</p>
