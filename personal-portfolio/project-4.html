 <h1>Project 4</h1> 
 <h3>MAKE A REPAIR</h3>
  
 <p>This is a project I did for a previous course in which the topic was "make a repair". I had been going through a rough patch due to some personal issues
  and decided to center this project on me. I was reparing my self. Art has always been my emotional outlet and in doing this project I gave myself the time 
  and space to heal and do what I love. It also sort of mimicked a stress-therapy coloring book that i basically made for myself.</p>
